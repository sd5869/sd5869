### Hi there 👋 I'm Siddharth Dungarwal

I’m an engineer with 3+ years of experience who cares about building software that is reliable, readable, and maintainable. My strongest skills are NodeJS and Python. I have experience working with startups and fast-moving teams with fixed deadlines. Give me a problem and I can try solving it by writing code.
